Eagle Rock Advisors LLC (**“Company,” “us,” our” **or** “we”**) welcomes its users and respects their privacy. This Privacy Policy informs you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use, access, storage and disclosure of any Personal Information (as defined below) you submit to us and/or we collect about you online through your use of the Services, why we collect it, how we use it, and when we share it with third parties. This Privacy Policy also describes the choices you can make about how we collect and use certain of that information. The Personal Information provided by you is not used for any purpose other than as outlined in this Privacy Policy. Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings given in our Terms of Use1. This Privacy Policy is part of, and incorporated into, the Terms of Use.\\

By accessing and using the Services you consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your Personal Information and other information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not provide any Personal Information to us. If you choose not to provide any Personal Information that is necessary for us to provide you with specific products or service, we may not be able to provide those products or services to you. In addition, for certain products or services, we may further confirm your consent by asking you to expressly consent to the collection, processing, storage and use of your personal information according to this Privacy Policy.\\

This Privacy Policy applies to visitors and users of our website (the “**Website**”), and any other features, content, or services offered from time to time by us in connection with the Website (collectively, the “**Services**”), and set forth the legally binding terms for your use of our Services. This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected on or through our Website and Services and does not include information collected through any other means, including, without limitation, information collected offline, in person, and/or by mail. Because we use Google Maps API, you also agree to Google’s Privacy Policy.

This Website is primarily intended to provide information to and collect inquiries from prospective investors. While we may collect certain personal and financial information in connection with evaluating or onboarding investors, this generally occurs outside of the Website through secure data rooms or third-party platforms, such as our fund administrator.

###### **1. Types of Information We Collect**

a. Personal Information that we collect about you. We collect Personal Information about our users. “Personal Information” is information relating to an individual that can be used to contact or identify you or other individuals associated with your investment inquiry or participation, including: name, email address, phone number, address, date of birth, Social Security number, tax ID, employment and financial information, bank account details, wire instructions, and information related to identity verification. Such information may be collected directly from you or via our third-party fund administrator (e.g., Alter Domus) or other secure channels. We do not collect this information through public browsing of the Website.

b. “Aggregated Information”. After stripping out any information that directly identifies you, or directly relates to you, from the Personal Information that we collect about you, we may combine that information with information we collect about other users.

c. Cookies. We use first-party cookies that are strictly necessary for the operation of our Website, as well as performance and analytics cookies to understand how visitors interact with the Website. We do not use functionality or advertising/targeting cookies. All analytics are anonymized and processed through Google Analytics 4. No third-party cookies are used on the Website.

d. Unique Device Identifiers. Like most website providers, we passively collect certain information from your devices, such as your IP address, browser information, unique device identifier (“UDID”) and/or your mobile operating system.

e. User-Provided Information. We collect information you provide through forms on the Website, email, or phone communications, such as when you inquire about investment opportunities, request information, or submit documentation to assess investment eligibility. Additional sensitive information, including financial data and SSNs, may be requested via secure channels when required to comply with legal obligations or to complete onboarding and verification processes.

We may correlate this information with other Personal Information we have about you. We collect e-mail lists and information related to marketing services. When you use the Website, you may be given the option to subscribe to our subscription or e-mail list. Whether or not you select this option, your Personal Information may be shared with third parties consistent with this Privacy Policy. You may opt-out or unsubscribe from these e- mail lists.

f. Information Collected via Technology.

* Information Collected by Our Servers. To make our Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.
* Information About Your Mobile Device. If you use our Services on your mobile device, we may collect your Sensor’s battery level, the version of iOS used by your device, the serial number and firmware version of your Sensor, the signal strength of your mobile device, notifications regarding errors related to your Sensor or mobile device, your test results, and other relevant diagnostics that come from syncing the sensor with your mobile device, such as temperature and time of readings.
* Log Files. As is true of most websites and applications, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp.
* Geolocation. If you access the Services through a desktop or mobile device, we will collect, monitor and/or remotely store geo-location data.
* Our Website includes an embedded Google Maps feature to display location information. Your use of this feature may result in limited data being collected by Google. Please refer to Google’s Privacy Policy for more information.\\

g. Third-Parties. We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect directly. For example:

* We may also collect information about you from third parties, including but not limited to identity verification services, fraud detection service providers, credit bureaus, publicly available sources, and other third-party service providers.
* We use third-party services, such as Google Analytics to track and analyze online behavior of our Users. We do this to better understand how you use the Website and Service, with a view to offering improvements for all Users, and to tailor our business and marketing activities accordingly.
* When you interact with us through social media networks, such as when you follow us, share content or contact us through social media platforms (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat) or other websites, we may receive information about you, including your profile information, picture, user ID associated with the social media account, friends list, and any other information you permit the social media network to share with third parties. The data we receive is dependent upon your privacy settings with the social network or website in question.

h. Third-Party Fund Administration. We may collect or receive Personal Information in connection with your investment activity, including through third-party fund administration platforms such as Alter Domus. This information may include your Social Security number or tax identification number, financial account details, capital contribution amounts, and identity verification materials. These providers act on our behalf and are subject to appropriate confidentiality and data protection obligations. Where you interact directly with third-party platforms (e.g., fund administrators or investor portals), those parties may maintain separate privacy policies governing your use of their services.

We do not use cookies for behavioral advertising, retargeting, or cross-site tracking, and no user data is shared with ad platforms. Our implementation includes IP anonymization and honors applicable browser privacy signals via Google’s Consent Mode. The Services may contain links to and/or enable certain third-party functionalities to enhance your experience on or with the Services, including social plug-ins, tools and APIs. Prior to using any third-party functionalities (e.g., Facebook “Like” button) on the Website, you should consult the privacy notices of the third-party providers of such functionalities (e.g., Facebook). The privacy policies and data practices of such third parties may significantly differ from ours, and we make no representation or warranty whatsoever about their policies and practices in respect of their own processing of your Personal Information.

Furthermore, if we have already disclosed your Personal Information to third-parties pursuant to the terms of this Privacy Policy, we cannot access that Personal Information any longer and cannot compel the deletion or modification of any such information by the parties to whom we have made those disclosures.

###### **9. Notice to Californian Users Regarding Your Privacy Rights**

a. **Shine the Light.** Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, California residents have the right to request in writing from businesses with whom they have an established business relationship: (i) a list of the categories of Personal Information, such as name, address, e-mail address, and the type of services provided to that individual, that a business has disclosed to third-parties (including affiliates that are separate legal entities) during the immediately preceding calendar year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes, and (ii) the names and addresses of all such third-parties. We do not share Personal Information with third parties for those parties’ direct marketing. To request the above information, California residents can e-mail us at contact us via e-mail at [privacy@eaglerockmanagement.com](mailto\:privacy@eaglerockmanagement.com) or by writing to us at Eagle Rock Advisors LLC, Attn: Privacy Office, 1670 Old Country Road Suite 227 Plainview, New York 11803. Please note that, under California law, a business is only required to respond to such a request twice in any calendar year.

b. **Access To Specific Information and Data Portability Rights.** You have the right, subject to certain exceptions defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act, Cal. Civ. Code §1798.100 et. seq. (“CCPA”), and other applicable laws and regulations, to request that companies disclose certain information to you about their collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. This right to know includes information about:

* the categories of personal information we collected about you;
* the categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you;
* our business or commercial purpose for collecting that personal information;
* the categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information;
* the categories of personal information that each recipient received; and
* the specific pieces of personal information we collected about you.

c. **Deletion Request Rights.** You have the right, subject to certain exceptions defined in the CCPA and other applicable laws and regulations, to request that a company delete any of your personal information that it has collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.

d. **Exercising Access, Data Portability, And Deletion Rights.** To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by e-mailing us at [privacy@eaglerockmanagement.com](mailto\:privacy@eaglerockmanagement.com).

The verifiable consumer request must:

* Provide sufficient information that allows us to verify, to a reasonably high degree of certainty, that you are the person about whom we collected personal information. This may include requesting that you provide us with at least two or more pieces of personal information to match against personal information about you that we may or may not maintain and which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verification.
* Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.

e. **Do Not Sell Rights.** You have the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information. We do not sell your personal information in exchange for money. We do not currently share personal information including identifiers and commercial data with advertising platforms (e.g., Google, Meta) for the purposes of targeted advertising and audience creation. This may be considered a 'share' under California and other state privacy laws. While we don’t engage in this type of data sharing, you may opt out of this type of data sharing by following the instructions in Section 7 and this Section 9, using recognized browser signals (e.g., Global Privacy Control), or by contacting us at [privacy@eaglerockmanagement.com](mailto\:privacy@eaglerockmanagement.com).

We may deny a Do Not Sell request if we have a good-faith, reasonable, and documented belief that the request is fraudulent.

f. **Authorized Agent.** Only you, or a person you have designated in writing as your authorized agent, or who is registered with the California Secretary of State to act on your behalf, or to whom you have provided power of attorney pursuant to California Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465, (“**Authorized Agent**”), may make a verifiable consumer request or do not sell request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request or do not sell request on behalf of your minor child.

If you wish to have an Authorized Agent make a request on your behalf, they will need to provide us with sufficient written proof that you have designated them as your Authorized Agent and we will still require you to provide sufficient information to allow us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected personal information.

g. **Non-Discrimination.** You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:

* deny you services;
* charge you different prices or rates for services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties;
* provide you a different level or quality of services; or
* suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for services or a different levelor quality of services.

To the extent required by applicable law, California residents may ask us to provide them with (i) a list of certain categories of personal information that we have disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, and (ii) the identity of those third parties. To make this request, California residents may contact us as specified in the Contact Us section of this Online Privacy Notice.

h. **Do Not Track.** Some web browsers may let you enable a "do not track" feature that sends signals to the websites you visit, indicating that you do not want your online activities tracked. This is different than blocking or deleting cookies, as browsers with a "do not track" feature enabled may still accept cookies. There is currently no industry standard for how companies should respond to "do not track" signals, although one may develop in the future. While we do not respond to browser initiated “Do Not Track” signals, we do recognize Global Policy Control (GPC) signals as a valid opt-out request where required by law.

Although guaranteed security does not exist either on or off the Internet, we make commercially reasonable efforts to make the collection and security of such information consistent with this Privacy Policy and all applicable laws and regulations. Your consent to such purpose remains valid after termination of our relationship with you.
